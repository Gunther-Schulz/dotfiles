# Dotfiles

## Installation and instructions

Currently not much is automized and many things have to be installed manually.
At some point more and more things will be automized and fewer things have to
be installed manually.

## Brew

The current plan is to use Homebrew on the mac and linuxbrew on linux

### ThinkVim
